# Weekly-Algo-Newsletter
## Algorithms Analysis & Design Course Project 


The sole idea of the project is to make a Weekly Newsletter. This newsletter will consist of different Algorithms and Data Structures and their applications. The structure of every newsletter will be as follows:-

- History of algorithm
- Data structure involved
- Required Mathematics
- Related images (if any)
- Pseudo Code
- Implementation of questions based on the algorithm
- Some real-life applications of the algorithm
- Summary
- Tags of the algorithm
- Resources for learning
